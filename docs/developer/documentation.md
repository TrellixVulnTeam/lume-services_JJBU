## MkDocs
For documentation, we use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to automatically generate our [GitHub documentation](https://jacquelinegarrahan.github.io/lume-services/) using the mkdocs.yml packaged in the root of the project directory.


`docs/api` contains the API documentation compiled from docstrings.

This doesn't happen automatically
